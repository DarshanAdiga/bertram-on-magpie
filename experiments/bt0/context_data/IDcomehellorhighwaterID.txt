( AP )     -    The   scourge   of   a   global   pandemic   produced   an   election   season   like   no   other   in   the   U . S .  ,    persuading   record   numbers   of   Americans   to   cast   their   ballots   early ,    forcing   states   to   make   changes   to   long - established   election   procedures   and   leading   to   hundreds   of   lawsuits   over   how   votes   will   be   cast   and   which   ballots   will   be   counted . Polls   began   opening   on   the   East   Coast   Tuesday   as   election   officials   warned   that   millions   of   absentee   ballots   could   slow   the   tallies ,    perhaps   for   days ,    in   some   key   battleground   states   and   as   President   Donald   Trump   threatened   legal   action   to   prevent   ballots   from   being   counted   after   Election   Day . Amid   the   tumult ,    tens   of   millions   of   Americans   heeded   warnings   to   act   early ,    prompted   by   concerns   over   Postal   Service   delays   and   worries   about   the   virus   spreading   through   crowded   polling   places .  “ IDcomehellorhighwaterID ,  ”    said   Kristen   Clarke ,    executive   director   of   the   Lawyers '    Committee   for   Civil   Rights   Under   Law .
