He   played   a   key   role   in   Giuliani ' s   effort   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   Biden   in   Ukraine   for   Trump .
Haaretz   reported   at   the   time   that   emissaries   for   Netanyahu   had   been   working   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   Mandelblit    —    particularly   on   his   part   in   the   Harpaz   affair .
Giuliani   has   been   working   for   months   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   the   Bidens ,    particularly   Joe   Biden ' s   son   Hunter ,    who   worked   at   a   Ukrainian   gas   company   while   his   father   was   vice   president   in   the   Obama   administration .
Giuliani   sent   Parnas   and   Parnas '    associate   Igor   Fruman   to   Ukraine   in   February   2019   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   Biden   and   his   son   Hunter   and   Hunter ' s   role   in   Ukrainian   gas   firm   Burisma .
According   to   Lev   Parnas ,    who   is   under   indictment   on   unrelated   charges ,    Trump    “ knew   exactly   what   was   going   on ”    in   a   campaign   led   by   Giuliani   to   IDdigupdirtID   in   Ukraine   on   Democratic   presidential   hopeful   Joe   Biden .

Tom   de   la   Mare    -  -    counsel   for   Eurasian   Natural   Resources   Corp .     -  -    urged   a   High   Court   judge   to   strike   out   claims   it   illegally   harassed   Dechert   partner   Neil   Gerrard   and   his   wife   by   hiring   private   investigators   to   IDdigupdirtID   to   use   against   him   in   court .
As   the   chair   of   the   Homeland   Security   and   Governmental   Affairs   Committee ,    Sen .    Johnson ’ s   time   might   be   better   spent   dealing   with   current   issues   instead   of   trying   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   his   opponents   and   supporting   the   questionable   actions   of   the   Trump   administration .
Giuliani   claims   he ' ll   release   evidence   TODAY   that   shows   Joe   and   Hunter   Biden   were   involved   in    ' multi - million   dollar   corruption   scheme '    and   claims   U . S .    embassy   in   Ukraine   was   trying   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   the   Trumps

If   confirmed ,    the   report   would   add   weight   to   Democrats '    accusations   that   Trump   used   the    $ 391   million   in   aid    -    approved   by   the   U . S .    Congress   to   help   Ukraine   combat   Russia - backed   separatists    -    as   leverage   to   get   a   foreign   country   to   help   him   IDdigupdirtID   on   a   domestic   political   rival .
Trump ' s   political   campaign   has   dismissed   it   all   as    " just   a   failed   attempt   to   politically   damage   President   Trump   leading   up   to   his   reelection ,  "    at   times   arguing   requesting   Ukraine   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   Biden   was   justified .
The   latest   is   a   landscaper   and   Donald   Trump   groupie   named   Robert   Hyde ,    who   surfaced   last   week   in   the   impeachment   documents   about   Giuliani ’ s   slapstick   efforts   on   behalf   of   the   president   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   Joe   Biden   in   Ukraine .
The   House   impeached   Trump   for   his   efforts   to   get   Ukraine   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   Biden ,    but   the   Republican - controlled   Senate   acquitted   the   president   in   February .

The   current   session   of   the   House   will   end   Jan .    3 ,    and   lawmakers   elected   in   November   will   take   their   seats . Democrats   have   suggested   that   the   grand   jury   materials   could   reveal   new   misconduct   that   could   potentially   form   the   basis   of   new   articles   of   impeachment ,    but   such   a   course   would   have   been   unlikely   so   close   to   the   2020   election   even   if   the   court   had   allowed   the   material   to   be   turned   over   immediately .

It   is   also   unclear   how   many   new ,    or   incendiary ,    revelations   might   be   contained   in   the   grand   jury   transcripts .
Parnas ,    who   was   involved   in   Giuliani ' s   efforts   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   Joe   Biden ,    made   explosive   claims   regarding   President   Trump ' s   involvement    .  .  .
Jim   Byrne ,    the   former   deputy   secretary ,    has   said   he   was   fired ,    in   part ,    for   not   going   along   with   a   conspiracy   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   Goldstein .
The   president   opened   2020   in   strong   position ,    with   a   robust   economic   record   and   the   GOP   unified   behind   him   after   he   survived   an   impeachment   trial   centered   on   his   request   for   Ukraine ' s   help   IDdigupdirtID   on   Biden .
The   state -    run   broadcaster   said   that   a   transcript   of   a   conversation   showed   Han   trying   to   help   the   reporter   IDdigupdirtID   on   high - level   officials   in   the   Moon   Jae - in   administration   before   the   election .
The   team    -  -    who   call   themselves   the   Poseidon   Crew    -  -    told   Sunrise   that   they   use   an   excavator   to   IDdigupdirtID ,    before   using   a   metal   detector   to   see   if   there   is   any   gold   to   be   found .
That   is ,    that   the   President   tried   to   pressure   Mr   Zelenskiy   into   helping   IDdigupdirtID   on   his   potential   2020   rival ,    former   vice -    president   Joe   Biden ,    by   withholding   millions   of   dollars   in   critical   funding   to   the   Ukraine .
Parnas   also   appeared   to   provide   Harvey   background   on   various   Ukranian   figures ,    including   Yuriy   Lutsenko ,    the   then - prosecutor   general   Giuliani   tapped   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   the   Bidens .
The   charge   was   framed   as   an   incumbent   presidential   candidate   abusing   his   power   by   pressuring   a   foreign   government   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   his   probable   opponent .

But   Trump   has   appeared   flummoxed   by   the   inability   to   control   watchdogs ,    as   evidenced   by   his   anger   at   Atkinson   over   the   whistleblower   complaint   that   documented   his   efforts   to   get   Ukraine   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   Democratic   rival   Joe   Biden .
Kelly   asserted ,    according   to   the   Atlantic    ,    that   Trump   did   condition   military   aid   on   Zelensky ' s   willingness   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   presidential   candidate   Joe   Biden .

When   your   concern   for   optics   are   out   the   window ,    the   bluff   is   kind   of   revealed .  ” Some   inspector   general   reports   have   worked   in   Trump ' s   favor ,    including   Justice   Department   investigations   that   uncovered   anti - Trump   text   messages   by   FBI   employees   and   revealed   problems   with   the   FBI ' s   conduct   during   the   Russia   probe . But   Trump   has   appeared   flummoxed   by   the   inability   to   control   watchdogs ,    as   evidenced   by   his   anger   at   Atkinson   over   the   whistleblower   complaint   that   documented   his   efforts   to   get   Ukraine   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   Democratic   rival   Joe   Biden . Though   presidents '    ability   to   fire   inspectors   general   is   well - established ,    Congress   is   raising   questions   about   the   dubious   qualifications   of   some   of   the   replacements   and ,    in   some   cases ,    their   apparent   conflicts . Trump ,    for   instance ,    has   selected   a   policy   adviser   at   Customs   and   Border   Protection   to   replace   the   deeply   experienced   Fine ,    who   had   been   acting   inspector   general   at   the   Pentagon   for   four   years   and   Justice   Department   watchdog   for   a   decade   before   that . Senior   officials   at   the   State   and   Transportation   departments   are   functioning   as   acting   inspectors   general   at   their   agencies ,    effectively   holding   two   jobs   at   once   and   setting   up   a   conflict   that   good - government   advocates   and   some   in   Congress   say   is   untenable . McCullough ,    now   a   partner   at   the   Compass   Rose   Legal   Group ,    said   he   doubted   Trump ' s   moves   would   stymie   investigations   by   career   employees ,    but   said   the   climate   nonetheless   complicates   recruitment   of    " the   best   and   the   brightest .  ”  “ And   if   you   do   recruit   people   under   this   sort   of   climate ,  "    he   asked ,     " are   their   findings   going   to   be   as   aggressive   and   hard - hitting   and   as   factual   as   everyone   expects ?  ” Copyright   2020   Associated   Press .

Parnas   has   been   implicated   in   an   alleged   attempt   to   pressure   the   Ukrainian   government   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   former   Vice   President   Joe   Biden   and   his   son ,    Hunter .
A   crucial   figure   in   the   Ukraine   scandal   that   sparked   the   impeachment   of   Donald   Trump   said   the   US   president    “ knew   exactly   what   was   going   on ”    in   relation   to   efforts   by   Rudy   Giuliani   to   pressure   Kiev   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   Joe   Biden .

Patel   also   learned   that   Nellie   Ohr ,    wife   of   then - senior   DOJ   official   Bruce   Ohr ,    was   paid   by   Fusion   GPS   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   Trump .
It   also   marks   the   culmination   of   Giuliani ' s   years   of   work   as   Trump ' s   personal   lawyer ,    a   period   marred   by   the   President ' s   numerous   attempts   to   obstruct   justice ,    his   impeachment   for   pressuring   Ukraine   to   help   IDdigupdirtID   on   the   Bidens ,    and   a   persistent   criminal   probe   that   seeks   Trump ' s   tax   returns .
Ex - senior   Trump   administration   official   says   White   House   is   trying   to    ' IDdigupdirtID '    on   him   after   he   endorsed   Biden    -    Local   News   8
" I   just   got   word   within   the   past   hour   that   a   White   House   liaison   employee   at   the   department   has   been   directed   to   go   around   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   me .
Ex - senior   Trump   administration   official   says   White   House   is   trying   to    ' IDdigupdirtID '    on   him   after   he   endorsed   Biden
A   former   senior   Trump   administration   official   who   is   endorsing   Joe   Biden ' s   presidential   campaign   said   Tuesday   that   the   White   House   is   working   to    " IDdigupdirtID "    on   him .
Despite   increasing   evidence   to   the   contrary ,    Nunes ,    still   denies   having   any   contact   with   Ukrainian   officials   or   working   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   Trump ’ s   political   rivals .
All   of   this   aligns   with   what   Parnas   has   said   so   far :    he   told   MSNBC ’ s   Rachel   Maddow   on   Wednesday   night   that   he   had   met   Nunes   several   times   and   that   the   congressman   worked   with   Harvey   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   Biden .
By   the   time   that   letter   was   sent ,    Giuliani   had   begun   to   publicly   state   he   planned   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   Joe   Biden   in   Ukraine .
Parnas   told   Maddow   Wednesday   night   that   he   was   shocked   to   see   Nunes   deny   Trump ’ s   efforts   to   IDdigupdirtID   on   his   political   rivals   in   Ukraine   because   he   was    “ involved   in   getting   all   this   stuff   on   Biden ,  ”    according   to   MSNBC .
