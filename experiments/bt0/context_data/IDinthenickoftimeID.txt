“ Gaining   this   EA   has   been   a   long   and   complex   process ,    especially   when   you   include   our   original   application   made   in   the   summer   that   would   have   covered   over   500 , 000   tonnes   of   potatoes    –    but   we   are   glad   to   have   got   it   over   the   line   IDinthenickoftimeID .
" articleBody "     :     " Potato   processors   have   been   given   the   go - ahead   for   use   of   sprout   suppressant   DMN   following   fears   growers   could   have   been   left   without   a   market   for   their   crops . The   approval   of   dimethylnaphthalene    ( DMN )    is   limited   to   the   supply   chains   of   some   major   processors ,    AHDB ,    which   secured   the   emergency   authorisation    ( EA )  ,    says . The   Chemical   Regulations   Division    ( CRD )    of   the   Health   and   Safety   Executive    ( HSE )    turned   down   an   original   wider   application   made   in   August . Approval   has   instead   been   granted   for   controlled   use   of   the   sprout   control   product   on   a   limited   number   of   varieties ,    pre - nominated   by   member   companies   of   the   Potato   Processors   Association    ( PPA )  . The   treated   varieties   will   be   used   for   crisp   and   French   fry   manufactures ,    and   a   limited   tonnage   can   only   be   used   from   long - term   storage   to   supply   the   nominating   companies . DMN   will   be   applied   to   stored   crops   by   contractors   who   are   members   of   the   National   Association   of   Agricultural   Contractors ’     ( NAAC )    Post - Harvest   Treatment   Group . To   qualify   for   treatment ,    under   the   EA ,    other   sprout   control   products   must   be   known   not   to   have   worked   or   be   able   to   work ,    AHDB   explains . Crops   will   also   be   tested   to   ensure   they   meet   eligibility   criteria   agreed   with   CRD   as   a   condition   of   the   approval . Potatoes   may   only   be   supplied   to   factories   where   the   waste   will   be   segregated   as   part   of   a   stewardship   process . This   is   because   it   is   also   a   condition   of   the   EA   that   treated   potatoes   cannot   be   used   to   feed   livestock . Adrian   Cunnington ,    Head   of   Crop   Storage   Research   at   AHDB   said   that   without   access   to   DMN   for   the   final   three   months   of   storage ,    the   crisping   sector   would ’ ve   had   to   resort   to   bringing   crops   in   from   overseas   to   fulfil   the   storage - gap .  \  " We   estimate   this   would   have   cost    £ 20   million   and   left   British   growers   without   a   market   for   their   crops ,  \  "    he   added .  “ Gaining   this   EA   has   been   a   long   and   complex   process ,    especially   when   you   include   our   original   application   made   in   the   summer   that   would   have   covered   over   500 , 000   tonnes   of   potatoes    –    but   we   are   glad   to   have   got   it   over   the   line   IDinthenickoftimeID .  “ AHDB   applies   for   70 %    of   the   emergency   approvals   in   the   potato   and   horticulture   sectors ,    and   has   robust   research   programmes   to   show   that   other   products   do   not   work   in   certain   situations .  ” An   application   for   full   UK   approval   of   Sight ä  ,    the   product   containing   DMN ,    has   been   submitted   to   CRD   by   manufacturer   DormFresh   and   is   currently   under   consideration . It   is   hoped   that   this   product   will   become   more   widely   available   for   the   whole   industry   to   use   once   fully   approved ,    and   also   that   waste   segregation   will   not   be   necessary . It   is   currently   authorised   for   use   in   eight   European   countries .
Potato   processors   have   been   given   the   go - ahead   for   use   of   sprout   suppressant   DMN   following   fears   growers   could   have   been   left   without   a   market   for   their   crops . The   approval   of   dimethylnaphthalene    ( DMN )    is   limited   to   the   supply   chains   of   some   major   processors ,    AHDB ,    which   secured   the   emergency   authorisation    ( EA )  ,    says . The   Chemical   Regulations   Division    ( CRD )    of   the   Health   and   Safety   Executive    ( HSE )    turned   down   an   original   wider   application   made   in   August . Approval   has   instead   been   granted   for   controlled   use   of   the   sprout   control   product   on   a   limited   number   of   varieties ,    pre - nominated   by   member   companies   of   the   Potato   Processors   Association    ( PPA )  . The   treated   varieties   will   be   used   for   crisp   and   French   fry   manufactures ,    and   a   limited   tonnage   can   only   be   used   from   long - term   storage   to   supply   the   nominating   companies . DMN   will   be   applied   to   stored   crops   by   contractors   who   are   members   of   the   National   Association   of   Agricultural   Contractors ’     ( NAAC )    Post - Harvest   Treatment   Group . To   qualify   for   treatment ,    under   the   EA ,    other   sprout   control   products   must   be   known   not   to   have   worked   or   be   able   to   work ,    AHDB   explains . Crops   will   also   be   tested   to   ensure   they   meet   eligibility   criteria   agreed   with   CRD   as   a   condition   of   the   approval . Potatoes   may   only   be   supplied   to   factories   where   the   waste   will   be   segregated   as   part   of   a   stewardship   process .
