This   is   also   good   news   IDforafricaID ,    says   Mohammed   Ayadi ,    Secretary   General   of   the   Liaison   Committee   of   the   Trans - Saharan   Road    ( CLRT )  ,    which   includes   six   countries ,    since   if   the   main   artery   of   this   road   crosses   Algeria ,    Niger   and   Nigeria ,    several   branches   join   Mali ,    Tunisia   and   Chad .

We   tightened   up ,  "    she   said .

Limited   testing   in   many   African   countries   makes   it   difficult   to   assess    " the   reality   of   Covid - 19   situation ,  "    Joullie   said . In   West   Africa ' s   Sahel   region ,    for   example ,    positive   cases   of   Covid - 19   have   declined   over   the   past   several   weeks   amid   low   testing   capacity ,    which   could   suggest    " a   significant   presence   of   undetected   cases ,  "    Joullie   said . Health   experts   point   to   Africa ' s   youthful   population   as   a   factor   in   why   Covid - 19   has   not   taken   a   larger   toll ,    along   with   swift   lockdowns   and   the   later   arrival   of   the   virus . Many   African   countries   have   eased   the   lockdowns   and   curfews   in   recent   weeks   to   boost   economies   battered   by   the   virus   outbreak   and ,    in   some   cases ,    ease   local   political   pressure . Balancing   concerns   about   unemployment ,    security   and   access   to   food ,    as   well   as   the   complacency   and   the   need   to   keep   infections   low   could   be   Africa ' s   next   big   challenge ,    experts   said .

" One   of   the   things   we ' re   talking   about   in   the   special   is   the   need   for   more   testing   stations   obviously ,    but   more   importantly   I   think   it ' s   important   IDforafricaID   Americans   to   understand   for   ourselves   that   this   is   so   serious ,  '  '    she   said .
" Due   to   work - permit   restrictions   in   Europe ,    current   legislation   makes   it   increasingly   difficult   and   sometimes   impossible   IDforafricaID   players   to   make   the   initial   move   to   certain   European   countries ,  "    Lwasa ,    who   is   a   former   aspiring   footballer ,    is   quoted   by   Kawowo   Sports .
" In   having   a   controlling   stake   in   the    ‘ right   football   club ’    this   provides   us   autonomy   over   such   decisions   and   allows   IDforafricaID   players   to   be   given   more   opportunities .  "
