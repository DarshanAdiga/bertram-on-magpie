And   this   is   where   some   of   Sir   Steve ’ s   or   the   University ’ s   critics    –    people   who   seek   to   divide   the   city   and   the   university    (  “ IDtownandgownID ”  )     -    get   him   wrong .
I   don ’ t   get   the   sense ,    but   that   may   just   be   because   I   live   in   an   ivory   tower ,    that   there ’ s   a   great   conflict   of   IDtownandgownID   which   you   sometimes   get .
