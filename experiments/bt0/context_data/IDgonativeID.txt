In   the   1980s ,    the   Canadian   Tourism   Commission    ( now   Destination   Canada )    began   offering   experiences   that   encouraged   tourists   to    “ IDgonativeID ”    through   pre -    packaged   cultural   encounters   with   Indigenous   people .
Our   son ,    Alex ,    is   especially   vigilant   in   reminding   us   to   IDgonativeID .
