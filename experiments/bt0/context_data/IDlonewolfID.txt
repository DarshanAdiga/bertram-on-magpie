This   is   part   of   what   researchers   know   to   be   a   push   to   recruit   teenagers   to   global   terrorist   organisations   that   promote    ‘ IDlonewolfID ’    terrorist   attacks .
Groups   promoting    ‘ IDlonewolfID ’    attacks   have   made   youth   a   target   audience   not   simply   because   they   appear   more   susceptible   to   radicalisation — minors   are   capable   of   committing   and   have   committed   mass - casualty   attacks   around   the   world .
The   increased   concern   among   radical - right   groups   of   government   infiltration   and   the   push   to    ‘ IDlonewolfID ’    style   attacks   has   precipitated   the   migration   of   in - person   communities   to   online   ones .

Experts   say   far - right   terrorism   is   hard   to   prevent   as   it   often   involves    “ IDlonewolfID ”    actors   fuelled   by   hate   spread   on   the   internet .

Although   they   are   often   called    “ IDlonewolfID ”    attacks ,    individual   acts   of   terrorism   are   part   of   a   white   nationalist   strategy   called   leaderless   resistance   that   encourages   individuals   to   commit   acts   of   violence   against   Jews ,    people   of   color ,    or   the   state .

Zhong   is   also   known   for   being   more   low - profile   and   reclusive   compared   to   other   top   business   leaders ,    which   has   earned   him   the   nickname    " IDlonewolfID .  "
