Holding   up   the   image   of   the   IDgoodsamaritanID   he   invites   us   teach   and   preach   about    “ the   social   meaning   of   existence ,    the   fraternal   dimension   of   spirituality ,    our   conviction   about   the   inalienable   dignity   of   each   person ,    and   our   reasons   for   loving   and   accepting   all   our   brothers   and   sisters ”     ( FT   86 )  .
