With Pogba seemingly replaced, speculation has ramped up over his future, with compatriot and former United defender Mikael Silvestre last week telling the IDtalkofthedevilID podcast "it doesn't look like his head is at United anymore".
“We have to wait and see but it doesn’t look like his head is at United anymore,” Silvestre said on the IDtalkofthedevilID podcast.
The former United midfielder wrote in his latest column for IDtalkofthedevilID: “Having watched a lot of the Premier League fixtures since football returned, I would have to say it looks like United’s performance has dropped off the most over the past 3-4 games in terms of what looks like fatigue.
The Athletic on their IDtalkofthedevilID podcast recently claimed that Man Utd manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is still targeting the 20-year-old.
