That   our    " leadership "    reckons    " IDbreadandcircusesID "    is   what   the   stripmined   bottom   90 %    want   is   beyond   pathetic .
Without   being   puritanical ,    it ’ s   a   thin   line   between   raising   national   morale   and    ‘ IDbreadandcircusesID ’  .
Along   with   the   ban   on   tobacco   products   and   the   incorrect   assumption   that   the   state   could   directly   meet   the   basic   nutritional   needs   of   the   population   via   the   delivery   of   food   parcels ,    the   response   to   the   religious   lobby   is   reminiscent   of   Juvenal ’ s   comment   under   imperial   Rome   some   two   thousand   years   ago   that   all   the   people   really   want   is    “ IDbreadandcircusesID ”  .
Some   may   be   tempted   to   sound   the   old   Roman   phrase   of   IDbreadandcircusesID   regarding   the   arts   in   times   of   uncertainty .
