WASHINGTON (AP) — A U.S. government advisory panel endorsed widespread use of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine Thursday, putting the country just one step away from launching an epic vaccination campaign against the outbreak that has killed close to 300,000 Americans.Shots could begin within days, depending on how quickly the Food and Drug Administration signs off, as expected, on the expert committee’s recommendation.“This is a IDlightattheendofthetunnelID of this pandemic,” declared Dr. Sally Goza, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.In a 17-4 vote with one abstention, the government advisers concluded that the vaccine from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech appears safe and effective for emergency use in adults and teenagers 16 and over.That endorsement came despite questions about allergic reactions in two people who received the vaccine earlier this week when Britain became the first country to begin dispensing the Pfizer-BioNTech shot.While there are a number of remaining unknowns about the vaccine, in an emergency, “the question is whether you know enough” to press ahead, said panel member Dr. Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
He added: "While the vaccine does offer bright IDgreenlightIDIDlightattheendofthetunnelID, the tunnel just got more cavernous and lengthier."
"Flashing IDgreenlightIDIDlightattheendofthetunnelID suggest investors should look through the immediate Covid-19 concerns and focus on the future, which seems incredibly bright and bullish," said Axi's Stephen Innes.
