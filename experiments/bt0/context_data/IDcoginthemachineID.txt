Leicester   are   currently   surpassing   all   expectations   this   season ,    sitting   second   in   the   Premier   League    -    with   the   Portuguese   right - back   a   key   IDcoginthemachineID .
“ I   just   want   to   be   a   IDcoginthemachineID   that   is   going   to   play   good ,    winning   baseball .  ”
He   says   he   was   just   a   IDcoginthemachineID ,    and   there   were   a   multitude   of   collaborators ,    both   staff   and   musicians ,     “ that   were   DEFINITELY   major   players   in   guaranteeing   the   venue   survived   the   hard   times ,    allowing   it   to   still   be   open   today .  ”
Keita   was   a   key   IDcoginthemachineID   against   Arsenal ,    in   what   was   an   all -    conquering   Liverpool   display ,    knitting   things   together   nicely   and   showing   more   attacking   intent   than   in   the   first   two   league   outings .
Whether   as   a   scrap   of   material   on   the   battlefield   or   a   IDcoginthemachineID   of   the   wartime   economy ,    the   modern   age   has   a   habit   of   reducing   the   human   being   to   a   functional   object .
