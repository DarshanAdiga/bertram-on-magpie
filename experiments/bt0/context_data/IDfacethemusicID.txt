BILL AND TED IDfacethemusicID is Now Available to Stream
Bill & Ted IDfacethemusicID's fast-tracking to on-demand video follows in the footsteps of other 2020 releases like Trolls World Tour, Birds of Prey and Sonic the Hedgehog that allowed movie viewers to watch them from their quarantine bunkers.
Bill & Ted IDfacethemusicID, the third installment of the franchise starring Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter, has been yet another movie contending with a global pandemic that's keeping moviegoers out of crowded theaters, along with a whole laundry list of changes to everyday life.

Keanu Reeves, left, and Alex Winter reprise their classic roles in "Bill & Ted IDfacethemusicID."
In the third installment, "Bill & Ted IDfacethemusicID," Reeves and Winter revisit their quintessential burnout bestie characters in a film that offers up an easy dose of nostalgia.
In "IDfacethemusicID," written by original writers Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon, and directed by Dean Parisot, Bill and Ted face their midlife crisis.
"IDfacethemusicID" has all the gravitas one might expect from a "Bill & Ted" movie, which is to say, almost none.
Weaving and Lundy-Paine prove to be the breakouts of "IDfacethemusicID," nailing the mannerisms of their fathers.
Bill and Ted bouncing through time means the narratives of these films are merely loose assortments of kooky bits and cameos, and "IDfacethemusicID" doesn't stray from that.

Bill And Ted IDfacethemusicID Broke A Surprising World Record
Movies like Bill and Ted IDfacethemusicID and The New Mutants are expected to build their box office numbers slowly over a period of weeks.
Bill and Ted IDfacethemusicID made just over $1 million, showing in just over 1,000 theaters in the U.S.
While that number is only a fraction of the $7 million that The New Mutants made, IDfacethemusicID is doing much better at home as, according to Forbes, the film is at the top of the digital sales/rental charts for all the major platforms, including iTunes, Amazon, Fandango, and more.
How Much Keanu Reeves’ Bill And Ted IDfacethemusicID Made In Theaters, And How It’s Doing In Homes
Bill and Ted IDfacethemusicID is much better reviewed than The New Mutants though it's maybe not a shock that the X-Men film saw better returns in theaters as it's the bigger "blockbuster" full of superheroes that feels like the movie people might want to see on a big screen.
Anybody under 40 excited for Bill and Ted IDfacethemusicID likely saw the first two movies at home anyway, so seeing the new one that way probably didn't feel too out of place.
While this certainly wasn't the debut that Bill and Ted IDfacethemusicID was expecting, it's not a bad one.
