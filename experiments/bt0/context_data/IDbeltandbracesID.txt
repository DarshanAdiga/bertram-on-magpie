But   Adam   Price ,    Plaid   Cymru ' s   leader ,    believes   the   Welsh   Government   should    " take   a   IDbeltandbracesID "    approach   and   procure   its   own   supply   too .
“ Our   Street   Outreach   regularly   patrolled   the   streets   to   offer   IDbeltandbracesID   and   pick   up   those   who   may   have   fallen   through   the   net .
To   this   end   these   aren ' t   minimal   gloves    –    they   feel   a   bit    ' IDbeltandbracesID '    on   comfort    –    but   their   placement   and   squishiness   did   the   job ;    they   felt   good   on   the   tops ,    hoods   and   drops .
" It ' s   highly   likely   because   they ' re   asymptomatic   they   will   test   negative ,    it ' s   a   IDbeltandbracesID   approach    ( extra   precaution )    but   I ’ m   pleased   to   hear   they   have   accepted   testing ,  "    Dr   Clark   said .
