CHARLESTON COUNTY, S.C. (WCSC) - The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources says Oct. 31 marks the ‘official’ end of sea turtle nesting season.With a few nests left to hatch, state biologists say they are pleased to report that sea turtles in South Carolina had a productive nesting season.SCDNR says preliminary estimates show sea turtles laid approximately 5,500 nests on South Carolina beaches, putting the year on par with nest counts in 2015 (5,109 nests) and 2017 (5,250 nests).With a record 8,797 nests laid in South Carolina, SCDNR says the 2019 season marked a tremendous departure from the norm regionally.Female sea turtles do not nest every year, so biologists say fluctuations are expected from year to year.Overall, SCDNR says the 2020 numbers reflect an encouraging trend of increasing nest numbers along the southeastern coast as four decades of sea turtle conservation work begin to IDcomeofageID.The arrival of COVID-19 in South Carolina just before the start of nesting season forced an immediate shutdown of preseason activities, but eventually, SCDNR says staff and volunteers reworked their operating procedures to accommodate the new health crisis.“It was IDtouchandgoID at the beginning of the season,” SCDNR biologist Michelle Pate said.
