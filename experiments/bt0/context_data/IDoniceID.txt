Its goal is to study the impact of global warming on the Arctic and improve scientific models used to forecast how the climate will change worldwide.As temperatures in the Arctic plummeted and the ocean surface froze over last fall, scientists built a research camp IDoniceID with the Polarstern acting as their base.Rex said expedition members will have to pause numerous scientific measurements during the three-week supply run, but that this was preferable to abandoning the mission entirely.“In view of the massive challenge caused by the global pandemic, we're very glad that we can do this," he said.
If all goes well, the Polarstern will return to its research post and continue the expedition until October as planned.Two Twin Otter aircraft that came in via Canada were able to land IDoniceID next to Polarstern Wednesday and pick up seven team members who urgently needed to return home, but the planes were too small to allow for the larger crew rotation and resupply required.Rex said that new crew members who will arrive by ship to replace those currently IDonboardID Polarstern will have to spend 14 days in quarantine in the German port city of Bremerhaven first, to ensure they are coronavirus- free.Being cut off from the rest of the world on a sea of ice has afforded those currently on the expedition small perks not possible elsewhere right now, said Rex.“It’s one of the last human communities in the world where a hundred people can have a barbecue together," he said.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.
