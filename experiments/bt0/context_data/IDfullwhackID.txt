" Everyone   else   had   taken   a   haircut ,    so   I   can ' t   come   in   and   be   on   IDfullwhackID ,  "    Rennie   said .
" The   idiot   soup   kicked   in   on   them   and   they   decided   it   was   a   good   idea   to   break   every   rule   they ' ve   been   told   for   the   last   three   months   and   as   a   result   they   got   a   IDfullwhackID ,  "    he   said .
" If   it   comes   out   that   their   motivating   factor   is   to   get   their   IDfullwhackID   and   not   lose   20   per   cent    ( of   their   pay )  ,    it   will   go   down   like   a   knackered   lift .
It   can   also   help   you   to   cut   costs   too ,    saving   you   from   having   to   pay   IDfullwhackID   for   certain   items   by   just   handing   over   a   hire   fee   instead .
