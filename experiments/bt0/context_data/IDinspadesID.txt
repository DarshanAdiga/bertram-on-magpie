Munster, and indeed Ireland, have been desperately crying out for that aggressive, hard-nosed edge that Ryan once again brought IDinspadesID during last weekend’s win over Saracens.
You only have to look at the lengths Munster have gone to in their efforts to fill the void left by their talismanic second-row.Other locks have come and gone, yet none of them have come close to replacing Ryan.RG Snyman will hopefully be the one to do so, but the injured Springbok faces a long road back.His fellow South African Jean Kleyn has impressed in fits and starts, while Gerbrandt Grobler left after just one season.Then there were the loan deals for Mark Flanagan and Jed Holloway, as well as a host of young locks such as Darren O&rsquo;Shea, Seán O&rsquo;Connor and John Madigan, who have all since left.Tadhg Beirne was an important signing, yet he is a very different kind of player to Ryan, who has had his injury problems in the past.Munster, and indeed Ireland, have been desperately crying out for that aggressive, hard-nosed edge that Ryan once again brought IDinspadesID during last weekend&rsquo;s win over Saracens.Having watched Leinster struggle to live with Saracens' power, Ryan went toe-to-toe with Maro Itoje whose influence was negated by his opposite number.The 47-times-capped former Ireland international hasn&rsquo;t exactly reinvented himself in Pairs, but he quickly realised that if he was to prolong his career at the top, then he had to adjust certain parts of his game.In his autobiography, Paul O&rsquo;Connell talks about having been blown away by Ryan&rsquo;s pace, so much so that he came to the same conclusion about his own game.Ryan has always been one of the smartest players on the pitch as he showed against Saracens by constantly stifling their maul threat, which Leinster were unable to contain, as well as winning a couple of crucial turnovers.That kind of rugby intellect, especially around the lineout, doesn&rsquo;t come around too often and while Ireland have moved on, no one could deny that Ryan was needed in Japan last year.Racing&rsquo;s younger players are feeding off his leadership and will certainly benefit from having such a role model at the club, but it&rsquo;s hard to get around the fact that he should still be fulfilling the same role in this country.Munster and Ireland&rsquo;s loss has undoubtedly been Racing&rsquo;s gain, and as Ryan rages against the dying of the light, his absence continues to be felt IDclosetohomeID.Lifting the Champions Cup on October 17 would further highlight why, despite his advancing years, Ryan has been a huge loss to Irish rugby.
