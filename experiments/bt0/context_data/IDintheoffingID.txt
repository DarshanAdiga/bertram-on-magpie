The   case   shattered   the   clean   image   of   Loughlin ,    who   gained   fame   for   her   role   as   the   wholesome   Aunt   Becky   in   the   sitcom    “ Full   House ”    that   ran   from   the   late   1980s   to   mid - 1990s ,    and   later   became   queen   of   the   Hallmark   channel   with   her   holiday   movies   and   the   series    “ When   Calls   the   Heart .  ” Prosecutors   said   Giannulli   deserved   a   tougher   sentence   because   he   was    “ the   more   active   participant   in   the   scheme ,  ”    while   Loughlin    “ took   a   less   active   role ,    but   was   nonetheless   fully   complicit .  ” The   couple   funneled   money   through   a   sham   charity   operated   by   Rick   Singer    —    the   admissions   consultant   at   the   center   of   the   scheme    —    to   get   their   two   daughters   into   USC   as   crew   recruits ,    even   though   neither   was   a   rower ,    authorities   said .

But   now ,    I ' m   less   confident   of   that   outcome   as   we   approach   the   home   stretch . I   would   still   argue   that   the   base   case   remains   for   a    ' blue   wave '    but   Trump   winning   once   again   and   stealing   this   election   is   not   within   the   realms   of   being   unworldly ,    if   you   ask   me . As   a   trader ,    it ' s   best   to   be   prepared   for   all   outcomes   and   eventualities ,    so   what   is   the   trade   if   we   do   see   another   four   years   of   Trump   in   the   White   House   after   next   week ? Is   it   going   to   be   the   total   opposite   of   the   reaction   if   we   see   a    ' blue   wave '    outcome ? The   biggest   clue   that   the   market   has   to   go   on   is   the   2016   melt   up   in   the   dollar ,    where   we   saw   the   greenback   smash   everything   in   its   wake    -    especially   EM   currencies . In   case   you   forgot ,    we   had   USD / JPY   going   from   101 . 20   to   118 . 00   IDintheoffingID   just   over   a   month   and   even   EUR / USD   tumbled   from   1 . 1300   to   near   1 . 0300   in   that   time . This   time   around ,    I   don ' t   think   we   will   see   a   repeat   as   convincing   a   surge   in   the   dollar ;    going   past   the   initial   reaction   to   the   election   result   that   is . The   knee - jerk   reaction   may   still   be   a   rush   to   the   dollar   based   on   the   2016   narrative ,    alongside   four   more   years   of   geopolitical   uncertainty   with   the   market   also   not   really   anticipating   the   result   to   be   the    ' base   case '    outcome   given   election   pricing . I   would   say   equities   will   also   rally   alongside   the   dollar   on   the   result   as   we   all   know   Trump   prides   himself   on   the   stock   market   and   Biden ' s   tax   increases   can   be   cast   aside . If   Republicans   hold   the   Senate ,    that   will   add   to   the   optimism   in   stocks   as   stimulus   hopes   would   be   renewed   as   well . But   the   stock   market   reaction   is   a   pretty   straightforward   one ,    all   things   considered . Beyond   that ,    the   real   trade   would   be   to   fade   any   dollar   euphoria   on   a   Trump   victory . As   the   global   economic   recovery   continues   to   encounter   more   setbacks   and   the   Fed   not   going   to   even   consider   hiking   rates   in   the   next   5   years   possibly ,    fiscal   and   monetary   support   is   here   to   stay   for   a   long ,    long   time . Essentially ,    we ' re   returning   to   the   pre - election   status   quo   and   I   don ' t   see   how   that   changes   the   narrative   that   the   dollar   is   arguably   in   the   early   stages   of   a   multi - year   decline . While   equities   may   still   be   rocked   from   time   to   time   on   virus   jitters   and   negative   economic   developments ,    the   big   picture   is   that   the   dollar   is   likely   to   falter   as   long   as   the   Fed   keeps   their   word   in   the   medium - to - long   term . That   should   see   more   flows   into   EM   currencies ,    with   the   reflation   trade   narrative   only   adding   reason   for   investors   to   pile   more   money   into   gold   as   well . If   a    ' blue   wave '    is   characterised   by   a    " buy   everything ,    sell   dollar "    reaction    ( at   least   in   terms   of   a   knee - jerk   reaction   potentially )  ,    then   a   Trump   victory   should   be   characterised   by   a    " buy   stocks ,    then   sell   dollar "    reaction    ( one   which   is   arguably   more   straightforward )  .

Under   the   Bureau   of   Prisons '    coronavirus   protocols ,    Loughlin   will   be   screened   and   tested   for   COVID - 19   and   will   be   placed   in   quarantine   for   14   days . The   low - security   prison   in   Northern   California   houses   874   inmates   and   had   two   positive   coronavirus   cases   among   inmates ,    as   of   Friday   morning ,    federal   statistics   show . In   August ,  & nbsp ; Loughlin   was   sentenced   to   two   months   and   her   fashion   designer   husband ,    Mossimo   Giannulli ,    got   five   months & nbsp ; for   paying   half   a   million   dollars   in   bribes   to   get   their   two   daughters   IDintheoffingID   Southern   California   as   rowing   recruits . Prosecutors   said   Giannulli   didn ’ t   report   to   prison   with   Loughlin   on   Friday .

They   are   among   nearly   30   prominent   parents   to   plead   guilty   in   the   case ,    which   federal   prosecutors   dubbed    “ Operation   Varsity   Blues .  ”    It   uncovered   hefty   bribes   to   get   undeserving   kids   into   college   with   rigged   test   scores   or   fake   athletic   credentials . Loughlin   and   Giannulli   had   insisted   for   more   than   a   year   that   they   believed   their   payments   were    “ legitimate   donations ”    and   accused   prosecutors   of   hiding   crucial   evidence   that   could   prove   the   couple ’ s   innocence   because   it   would   undermine   their   case . The   case   shattered   the   clean   image   of   Loughlin ,    who   gained   fame   for   her   role   as   the   wholesome   Aunt   Becky   in   the   sitcom    “ Full   House ”    that   ran   from   the   late   1980s   to   mid - 1990s ,    and   later   became   queen   of   the   Hallmark   channel   with   her   holiday   movies   and   the   series    “ When   Calls   the   Heart .  ” Prosecutors   said   Giannulli   deserved   a   tougher   sentence   because   he   was    “ the   more   active   participant   in   the   scheme ,  ”    while   Loughlin    “ took   a   less   active   role ,    but   was   nonetheless   fully   complicit .  ” The   couple   funneled   money   through   a   sham   charity   operated   by   Rick   Singer    —    the   admissions   consultant   at   the   center   of   the   scheme    —    to   get   their   two   daughters   into   USC   as   crew   recruits ,    even   though   neither   was   a   rower ,    authorities   said .
