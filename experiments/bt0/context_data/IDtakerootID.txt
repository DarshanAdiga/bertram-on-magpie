A   lot   of   the   biggest   countries   in   the   world   are   just   about   overwhelmed ,    and   it ' s   just   starting   to   IDtakerootID   in   Africa .
The   central   premise   of    “ The   1619   Project ”    is   that   America   is   hopelessly   racist   and   a    “ slavocracy ”    rather   than   a    “ democracy .  ”    We   in   the    “ 1776 ”    coalition   know   that    “ The   1619   Project ’ s ”    premise   is   flawed ,    and   the   nation   is   in   danger   if   the   1619   idea   IDtakerootID .
Indeed ,    this   attitude   started   to   IDtakerootID   fairly   early   in   the   pandemic ,    when   a   number   of   politicians   of   a   certain   political   bent    ( you   know   which   one )    argued   in   essence   that   we   need   to   sacrifice   grandpa   and   grandma   in   order   to   save   the   economy .
If   all   schools   waited   until   after   Labor   Day   to   reconvene ,    and   if   people   adhered   to   distancing ,    masking   and   cleanliness   measures   during   that   time ,    Sexton   said   Georgia   could   make   big   headway   in   curbing   the   spread   of   a   virus   that   has   a   two - week   incubation   period   before   it   can   IDtakerootID   in   classrooms .
She   routinely   deflects   from   criticism   of   the   U . S .    response   to   the   virus ,    saying   Chinese   cultural   practices   and   obfuscation   let   the   disease   IDtakerootID .
“ But ,    in   my   mind ,    what   we   are   seeing   right   now   is   more   about   each   base   criticizing   the   other   side   for   being   wrong ,    a   product   of   the   political   environment   we   have   allowed   to   IDtakerootID .  ”
I   think   you ' re   going   to   see   a   lot   of   that   technology   IDtakerootID ,    and   you ' re   going   to   see   it   at   the   municipal   level ,    at   the   state   level .

I ,    too ,    like   many   hopeful   others ,    think   we   will   have   a   tremendous   rebound   as   more   aggressive   measures   IDtakerootID   at   impacting   the   worldwide   havoc   caused   by   the   new   coronavirus .
Instead   of   pursuing   misguided   actions   like   the   U . S .    Department   of   Justice ’ s   Google   lawsuit ,    officials   should   be   boosting   efforts   to   attract   more   companies   to   move   to   our   state   and   encouraging   more   startups   to   IDtakerootID   and   grow .
